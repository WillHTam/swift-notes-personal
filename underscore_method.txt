Underscores before Methods

class Bar{
    func foo(s1: String, s2: String) -> String {
        return s1 + s2;
    }
}
When you call foo(), it is called like bar.foo("Hello", s2: "World").

But, you can override this behavior by using _ in front of s2 where it's declared.

func foo(s1: String, _ s2: String) -> String{
    return s1 + s2;
}
